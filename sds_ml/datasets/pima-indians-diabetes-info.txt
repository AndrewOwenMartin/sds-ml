The Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset involves predicting the onset of diabetes within 5 years in Pima Indians given medical details.

It is a binary (2-class) classification problem. The number of observations for each class is not balanced. There are 768 observations with 8 input variables and 1 output variable. Missing values are believed to be encoded with zero values. The variable names are as follows:

    Number of times pregnant.
    Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test.
    Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg).
    Triceps skinfold thickness (mm).
    2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml).
    Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2).
    Diabetes pedigree function.
    Age (years).
    Class variable (0 or 1).

The baseline performance of predicting the most prevalent class is a classification accuracy of approximately 65%. Top results achieve a classification accuracy of approximately 77%.
